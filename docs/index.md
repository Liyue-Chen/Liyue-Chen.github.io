## Biography

I got my Bachelor's degree (2020) from Xidian University in the School of Cyber Engineering. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Peking University supervised by Prof. [Leye Wang](https://wangleye.github.io/). My research interests include ubiquitous computing and urban computing, with special focus in spatiotemporal traffic prediction.

###  Spatial-temporal Prediction

Urban Computing Tool Box (UCTB) is a package providing spatial-temporal predicting models. It contains both conventional models and state-of-art deep learning models. Besides, benchmark datasets built from open data are included.

Our paper that introduces design considerations on various spatial and temporal factors, has been accepted by IEEE TKDE! More details in:

* L. Wang, D. Chai, X. Liu, L. Chen, & K. Chen. “Exploring the Generalizability of Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction: Meta-Modeling and an Analytic Framework”. IEEE Trans. Knowledge and Data Engineering, accepted (2021). [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09379.pdf)]
