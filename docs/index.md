# Liyue Chen (Ph.D. Student) ÈôàÊùéË∂ä

## Biography

I got my Bachelor's degree (2020) from Xidian University in the School of Cyber Engineering. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Peking University supervised by Prof. [Leye Wang](https://wangleye.github.io/). My research interests include ubiquitous computing and urban computing, with special focus in spatiotemporal data mining.
