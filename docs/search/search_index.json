Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Peking University under the supervision of Prof. Leye Wang . My Research interests include urban computing, with special focus in spatiotemporal traffic prediction. Email: chenliyue2019@gmail.com Research Projects UCTB: Open Source Spatiotemporal Toolbox Urban Computing Toolbox is a package providing spatial-temporal predicting models. It contains both conventional models and state-of-art deep learning models. Besides, benchmark datasets built from open data are included.
